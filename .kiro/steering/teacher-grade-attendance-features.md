// Get enrolled students
SELECT students.*, users.name, users.email, enrollments.*
FROM enrollments
JOIN students ON enrollments.studentId = students.userId
JOIN users ON students.userId = users.id
WHERE enrollments.courseId = courseId

// Get course scores
SELECT scores.*
FROM scores
JOIN enrollments ON scores.enrollmentId = enrollments.id
WHERE enrollments.courseId = courseId
ORDER BY scores.created DESC

// Calculate average
avgScore = Math.round(
  scores.reduce((sum, s) => sum + (s.score / s.maxScore) * 100, 0) / scores.length
)
```

### Attendance Tracking

**Data Sources**:
1. **Enrollments**: Student enrollment data
2. **Attendances**: Attendance records
3. **Users**: Student information

**Queries**:
```typescript

JOIN students ON enrollments.studentId = students.userId
JOIN users ON students.userId = users.id
WHERE enrollments.courseId = courseId

// Get attendance records
SELECT attendances.*
FROM attendances
JOIN enrollments ON attendances.enrollmentId = enrollments.id
WHERE enrollments.courseId = courseId
ORDER BY attendances.date DESC

// Calculate attendance rate
attendanceRate = Math.round((presentCount / totalRecords) * 100)
```
