## Data Flow

### Students List Query

```typescript
// Get all students enrolled in teacher's courses
db.select({
  studentId, studentName, studentEmail, studentPhoto,
  courseId, courseTitle,
  enrollmentId, progress, status, enrolled
})
.from(enrollments)
.innerJoin(courses, eq(enrollments.courseId, courses.id))
.innerJoin(students, eq(enrollments.studentId, students.userId))
.innerJoin(users, eq(students.userId, users.id))
.where(eq(courses.teacherId, session.user.id))
```

**Processing**:
1. Group by student ID to avoid duplicates
2. Calculate total courses per student
3. Calculate average progress
4. Find last enrollment date
5. Store course list per student

### Student Detail Query

```typescript
// Student information
db.select({ id, name, email, phone, photo, dob, gender, address, enrolled })
.from(students)
.innerJoin(users, eq(students.userId, users.id))
.where(eq(students.userId, id))

// Enrollments in teacher's courses
db.select({ enrollmentId, courseId, courseTitle, progress, status, ... })
.from(enrollments)
.innerJoin(courses, eq(enrollments.courseId, courses.id))
.where(and(
  eq(enrollments.studentId, id),
  eq(courses.teacherId, session.user.id)
))

// Scores, attendance, payments for all enrollments
```

**Statistics Calculation**:
- Total courses: Count of enrollments
- Completed courses: Count where status = 'completed'
- Avg progress: Sum of progress / count
- Avg score: Sum of (score/maxScore * 100) / count
- Attendance rate: (present count / total) * 100
- Total paid: Sum of completed payments

## User Experience
