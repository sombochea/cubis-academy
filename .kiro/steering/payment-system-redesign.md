# Payment System Redesign - Best Practices

## Current Issues

### Schema Problems
1. **Dual Foreign Keys**: `payments` table has both `enrollment_id` and `course_id`
2. **Ambiguity**: Unclear which field takes precedence
3. **Data Integrity**: `course_id` could differ from `enrollment.course_id`
4. **Complex Queries**: Need CASE statements to determine correct course

### Real-World Issues
```typescript
// Current schema allows this inconsistency:
payment {
  enrollmentId: "enrollment-123",  // Points to "Web Dev" course
  courseId: "course-456"            // Points to "UX Design" course ❌
}
```

## Recommended Solution: Single Source of Truth

### Option 1: Enrollment-Only Payments (RECOMMENDED)

**Principle**: All course payments MUST go through enrollments.

**Schema Changes**:
```typescript
export const payments = pgTable("payments", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey().default(uuidv7),
  studentId: uuid("student_id").notNull()
    .references(() => students.userId, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
  enrollmentId: uuid("enrollment_id").notNull()  // ✅ Required, not nullable
    .references(() => enrollments.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
  amount: decimal("amount", { precision: 10, scale: 2 }).notNull(),
  method: varchar("method", { length: 100 }),
  status: paymentStatusEnum("status").notNull().default("pending"),
  txnId: varchar("txn_id", { length: 255 }).unique(),
  proofUrl: varchar("proof_url", { length: 500 }),
  notes: text("notes"),
  created: timestamp("created").notNull().defaultNow(),
}, (table) => [
  index("payments_student_id_idx").on(table.studentId),
  index("payments_enrollment_id_idx").on(table.enrollmentId),
  index("payments_status_idx").on(table.status),
  index("payments_created_idx").on(table.created),
  index("payments_student_created_idx").on(table.studentId, table.created),
]);
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ No data inconsistency possible
- ✅ Simple queries (no CASE statements)
- ✅ Clear payment purpose
- ✅ Supports re-enrollment (each enrollment is unique)
- ✅ Proper cascade deletion

**Workflow**:
1. Student browses courses
2. Student enrolls → Creates `enrollment` record
3. Student makes payment → Creates `payment` with `enrollment_id`
4. Admin approves → Updates `enrollment.paid_amount`
5. Student re-enrolls same course → New `enrollment` record → New payments

**Query Simplification**:
```typescript
// Before (complex):
const payments = await db
  .select({
    courseTitle: sql`CASE 
      WHEN ${payments.enrollmentId} IS NOT NULL THEN ${courses.title}
      ELSE direct_course.title
    END`,
  })
  .from(payments)
  .leftJoin(enrollments, eq(payments.enrollmentId, enrollments.id))
  .leftJoin(courses, eq(enrollments.courseId, courses.id))
  .leftJoin(sql`${courses} as direct_course`, sql`...`);

// After (simple):
const payments = await db
  .select({
    courseTitle: courses.title,
  })
  .from(payments)
  .innerJoin(enrollments, eq(payments.enrollmentId, enrollments.id))
  .innerJoin(courses, eq(enrollments.courseId, courses.id));
```

### Option 2: Payment Types with Discriminator (Alternative)

If you need non-enrollment payments (donations, fees, etc.):

**Schema**:
```typescript
export const paymentTypeEnum = pgEnum("payment_type", [
  "enrollment",    // Course enrollment payment
  "donation",      // General donation
  "fee",          // Administrative fee
  "refund",       // Refund transaction
]);

export const payments = pgTable("payments", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey().default(uuidv7),
  studentId: uuid("student_id").notNull(),
  type: paymentTypeEnum("type").notNull().default("enrollment"),
  enrollmentId: uuid("enrollment_id")  // Required when type = 'enrollment'
    .references(() => enrollments.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
  amount: decimal("amount", { precision: 10, scale: 2 }).notNull(),
  // ... other fields
}, (table) => [
  // Add check constraint: enrollmentId required when type = 'enrollment'
]);
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Supports multiple payment types
- ✅ Clear payment purpose via `type` field
- ✅ Enrollment payments always linked to enrollment
- ✅ Flexible for future payment types

## Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Analyze Existing Data

```sql
-- Check if any payments have courseId but no enrollmentId
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments 
WHERE course_id IS NOT NULL AND enrollment_id IS NULL;

-- Check for inconsistencies
SELECT p.id, p.enrollment_id, p.course_id, e.course_id as enrollment_course_id
FROM payments p
LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON p.enrollment_id = e.id
WHERE p.enrollment_id IS NOT NULL 
  AND p.course_id IS NOT NULL 
  AND p.course_id != e.course_id;
```

### Step 2: Data Migration

```sql
-- Create enrollments for orphaned payments (if any)
INSERT INTO enrollments (student_id, course_id, status, total_amount, paid_amount, enrolled)
SELECT 
  p.student_id,
  p.course_id,
  'active',
  p.amount,
  CASE WHEN p.status = 'completed' THEN p.amount ELSE 0 END,
  p.created
FROM payments p
WHERE p.enrollment_id IS NULL AND p.course_id IS NOT NULL
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

-- Update payments to link to enrollments
UPDATE payments p
SET enrollment_id = e.id
FROM enrollments e
WHERE p.enrollment_id IS NULL 
  AND p.course_id IS NOT NULL
  AND e.student_id = p.student_id
  AND e.course_id = p.course_id;

-- Remove course_id column
ALTER TABLE payments DROP COLUMN course_id;
```

### Step 3: Update Schema

```typescript
// Remove courseId from schema
export const payments = pgTable("payments", {
  // ... other fields
  enrollmentId: uuid("enrollment_id").notNull()  // Now required
    .references(() => enrollments.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
  // courseId: removed ❌
});
```

### Step 4: Update Application Code

**Before**:
```typescript
// Complex payment creation
await db.insert(payments).values({
  studentId: session.user.id,
  enrollmentId: enrollmentId || null,
  courseId: courseId || null,  // ❌ Removed
  amount: amount,
});
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Simple payment creation
await db.insert(payments).values({
  studentId: session.user.id,
  enrollmentId: enrollmentId,  // ✅ Always required
  amount: amount,
});
```

## Updated Workflow

### Student Enrollment & Payment Flow

```
1. Browse Courses
   ↓
2. Click "Enroll" → Creates enrollment record
   - enrollment.total_amount = course.price
   - enrollment.paid_amount = 0
   - enrollment.status = 'active'
   ↓
3. Make Payment → Creates payment record
   - payment.enrollment_id = enrollment.id
   - payment.amount = (any amount)
   - payment.status = 'pending'
   ↓
4. Admin Approves → Updates enrollment
   - enrollment.paid_amount += payment.amount
   - payment.status = 'completed'
   ↓
5. Check Payment Status
   - If paid_amount >= total_amount → Fully paid
   - If paid_amount < total_amount → Partial payment
```

### Re-enrollment Scenario

```
Student completes "Web Dev 101" in 2024:
- enrollment_1 (completed, fully paid)

Student re-enrolls "Web Dev 101" in 2025:
- enrollment_2 (new record, active)
- New payments linked to enrollment_2
- Historical data preserved in enrollment_1
```

## Benefits of This Design

### 1. Data Integrity
- ✅ No ambiguous foreign keys
- ✅ Impossible to have course/enrollment mismatch
- ✅ Proper referential integrity

### 2. Query Simplicity
- ✅ No CASE statements needed
- ✅ Simple INNER JOINs
- ✅ Better query performance
- ✅ Easier to understand

### 3. Business Logic
- ✅ Clear payment purpose (always for enrollment)
- ✅ Supports partial payments
- ✅ Supports re-enrollment
- ✅ Proper payment history per enrollment

### 4. Scalability
- ✅ Easy to add payment types later (via discriminator)
- ✅ Clean data model for reporting
- ✅ Audit trail per enrollment
- ✅ No data cleanup needed

### 5. Developer Experience
- ✅ Less code complexity
- ✅ Fewer bugs
- ✅ Easier testing
- ✅ Better maintainability

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Partial Payments
```typescript
// Student enrolls in $500 course
const enrollment = await db.insert(enrollments).values({
  studentId: "student-123",
  courseId: "course-456",
  totalAmount: "500.00",
  paidAmount: "0.00",
});

// Payment 1: $200
await db.insert(payments).values({
  studentId: "student-123",
  enrollmentId: enrollment.id,
  amount: "200.00",
});
// After approval: enrollment.paidAmount = 200

// Payment 2: $150
await db.insert(payments).values({
  studentId: "student-123",
  enrollmentId: enrollment.id,
  amount: "150.00",
});
// After approval: enrollment.paidAmount = 350

// Payment 3: $150 (final)
await db.insert(payments).values({
  studentId: "student-123",
  enrollmentId: enrollment.id,
  amount: "150.00",
});
// After approval: enrollment.paidAmount = 500 (fully paid!)
```

### Example 2: Re-enrollment
```typescript
// 2024: First enrollment
const enrollment2024 = await db.insert(enrollments).values({
  studentId: "student-123",
  courseId: "web-dev-101",
  totalAmount: "500.00",
});
// ... payments linked to enrollment2024
// ... course completed

// 2025: Re-enrollment (refresher)
const enrollment2025 = await db.insert(enrollments).values({
  studentId: "student-123",
  courseId: "web-dev-101",  // Same course!
  totalAmount: "500.00",
});
// ... new payments linked to enrollment2025
// Both enrollments exist independently
```

## Comparison with Other Systems

### Udemy Model
- Purchases → Enrollments → Payments
- Each purchase creates enrollment
- Payments always linked to purchase/enrollment

### Coursera Model
- Subscriptions or one-time purchases
- Enrollments created on purchase
- Payments linked to subscription or enrollment

### Our Model (Recommended)
- Enrollment-first approach
- Supports partial payments
- Clear audit trail
- Flexible for future payment types

## Conclusion

**Recommendation**: Implement Option 1 (Enrollment-Only Payments)

This design follows industry best practices, ensures data integrity, simplifies queries, and provides a clear audit trail. The enrollment-first approach is standard in educational platforms and supports all required use cases including partial payments and re-enrollment.

**Key Principle**: Every payment must have a clear purpose (enrollment), and that purpose should be represented by a single, unambiguous foreign key relationship.
