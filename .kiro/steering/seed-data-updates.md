# Seed Data Updates

## Changes Made

### Fixed Payment System Integration

**Issue**: Seed file was using old payment schema with `courseId` field.

**Solution**: Updated to use new enrollment-only payment system.

### Key Changes

1. **Added course categories table**
   - Created 6 course categories with proper structure
   - Each category has: name, slug, description, icon, color
   - Courses now use `categoryId` (foreign key) instead of string

2. **Removed `courseId` from payments**
   - Payments now only use `enrollmentId`
   - Course information accessed via enrollment relationship

3. **Added enrollment payment tracking**
   - Set `totalAmount` on enrollments (course price)
   - Set `paidAmount` on enrollments (amount paid)
   - Demonstrates partial payment tracking

4. **Enhanced payment scenarios**
   - **Full payments**: Single transaction for full amount
   - **Partial payments**: 50% paid, balance outstanding
   - **Multiple installments**: 3 payments (40%, 30%, 30%)
   - **Pending payments**: Awaiting admin approval

5. **Added delivery modes**
   - Online courses (with YouTube/Zoom links)
   - Face-to-face courses (with physical locations)
   - Hybrid courses (both online and in-person)

6. **Realistic payment methods**
   - `bank_transfer`
   - `credit_card`
   - `mobile_payment`
   - `cash`
