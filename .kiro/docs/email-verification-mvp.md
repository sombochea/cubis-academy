# Email Verification MVP Implementation

## Overview

Phase 1 MVP implementation of email verification system for Cubis Academy. This ensures students verify their email addresses before enrolling in courses.

## Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Block Enrollment for Unverified Emails

**Location:** `app/api/enrollments/route.ts`

**Behavior:**
- Checks `email_verified_at` field before allowing enrollment
- Returns `403 Forbidden` with error code `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED`
- Provides clear error message to user

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Email verification required",
  "code": "EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED",
  "message": "Please verify your email address before enrolling in courses."
}
```

### 2. ✅ Show Verification Badge in Student Dashboard

**Components:**
- `components/student/VerifiedBadge.tsx` - Reusable badge component
- Updated `app/[locale]/(student)/student/page.tsx` - Shows badge next to name

**Features:**
- Green checkmark icon with "Verified" text
- Configurable sizes: `sm`, `md`, `lg`
- Optional text display
- Tooltip on hover

**Usage:**
```tsx
<VerifiedBadge size="md" showText />
```

### 3. ✅ Email Verification Flow

**Components:**
- `components/student/EmailVerificationBanner.tsx` - Warning banner for unverified users
- `app/api/auth/send-verification/route.ts` - Send verification code
- `app/api/auth/verify-email/route.ts` - Verify code and mark email as verified

**User Flow:**
1. Unverified student sees yellow warning banner on dashboard
2. Click "Verify Email" button
3. System generates 6-digit code (shown in dev mode)
4. Student enters code in dialog
5. Email marked as verified (`email_verified_at` set to current timestamp)
6. Dashboard refreshes, badge appears

**Development Mode:**
- Verification code displayed in dialog for testing
- Any 6-digit code accepted in development
- Console logs verification code

**Production Mode:**
- Code sent via email (Resend integration needed)
- Code validation against stored token
- 24-hour expiration

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Enrollment Error Handling

**Location:** `components/enroll-button.tsx`

**Features:**
- Detects `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` error code
- Shows yellow warning (not red error) for verification issues
- Provides "Go to Dashboard to Verify Email" link
- Standard red error for other enrollment failures

## Database Schema

**Field:** `users.email_verified_at`
- Type: `timestamp`
- Nullable: `true`
- Default: `null`

**States:**
- `null` = Email not verified
- `timestamp` = Email verified at this date/time

## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/auth/send-verification`

**Auth Required:** Yes (student session)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Verification email sent successfully",
  "devCode": "123456" // Only in development
}
```

**Errors:**
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `404` - User not found
- `400` - Email already verified

### POST `/api/auth/verify-email`

**Auth Required:** Yes (student session)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "code": "123456"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Email verified successfully",
  "verified": true
}
```

**Errors:**
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `404` - User not found
- `400` - Invalid code, already verified, or validation error

### POST `/api/enrollments`

**Auth Required:** Yes (student session)

**New Validation:**
- Checks `email_verified_at` before enrollment
- Returns `403` with `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` code if unverified

## Testing

### Development Testing

1. **Create unverified student:**
   - Register new student (email_verified_at = null)
   - Or manually set to null in database

2. **Test verification flow:**
   - Login as student
   - See yellow banner on dashboard
   - Click "Verify Email"
   - Use displayed 6-digit code
   - Verify success and badge appears

3. **Test enrollment blocking:**
   - Try to enroll in course (should fail)
   - Verify email
   - Try to enroll again (should succeed)

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Integrate Resend for email sending
- [ ] Create verification email template
- [ ] Store verification tokens in database (separate table)
- [ ] Implement token expiration (24 hours)
- [ ] Add rate limiting (max 3 codes per hour)
- [ ] Remove dev code display from response
- [ ] Add email verification during registration
- [ ] Send welcome email after verification

## Security Considerations

### Current (MVP)
- 6-digit numeric code
- Session-based authentication
- Server-side validation

### Production Enhancements Needed
- Store hashed tokens in database
- Implement expiration (24 hours)
- Rate limiting on code generation
- Rate limiting on verification attempts
- CSRF protection (Auth.js handles this)
- Prevent code reuse

## User Experience

### Unverified User
1. Sees yellow banner on dashboard
2. Cannot enroll in courses
3. Clear call-to-action to verify
4. Simple 6-digit code entry

### Verified User
1. Green badge next to name
2. No verification banner
3. Can enroll in courses
4. Badge visible in admin portal

## Admin Portal Integration

**Already Implemented:**
- Admin can see verification status (green checkmark)
- Admin can mark email as verified when changing email
- Verification status in both teacher and student tables

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### Phase 2
- [ ] Filter users by verification status in admin portal
- [ ] Bulk verification status export
- [ ] Manual verification by admin

### Phase 3
- [ ] Automated reminder emails to unverified users
- [ ] Verification rate analytics dashboard
- [ ] Email verification during registration flow
- [ ] SMS verification option

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `components/student/VerifiedBadge.tsx`
- `components/student/EmailVerificationBanner.tsx`
- `app/api/auth/verify-email/route.ts`
- `app/api/auth/send-verification/route.ts`

### Modified Files
- `app/api/enrollments/route.ts` - Added verification check
- `components/enroll-button.tsx` - Enhanced error handling
- `app/[locale]/(student)/student/page.tsx` - Added banner and badge

## Configuration

No environment variables required for MVP.

**Production Requirements:**
```env
# Resend API Key (for email sending)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxx

# Email sender
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@cubisacademy.com
```

## Monitoring

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Verification rate (verified / total students)
- Time to verification (registration → verification)
- Failed verification attempts
- Enrollment blocks due to unverified email

**Logs to Monitor:**
- Verification code generation
- Verification attempts (success/failure)
- Enrollment blocks

## Support

**Common Issues:**

1. **"I didn't receive the code"**
   - Check spam folder (production)
   - Resend code (max 3 times)
   - Contact admin for manual verification

2. **"Code doesn't work"**
   - Check expiration (24 hours)
   - Ensure correct code entry
   - Request new code

3. **"Already verified but still seeing banner"**
   - Refresh page
   - Clear cache
   - Check database `email_verified_at` field

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Disable verification requirement:**
   ```typescript
   // In app/api/enrollments/route.ts
   // Comment out verification check
   /*
   if (!user?.emailVerifiedAt) {
     return NextResponse.json(...);
   }
   */
   ```

2. **Bulk verify all users:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE users 
   SET email_verified_at = NOW() 
   WHERE email_verified_at IS NULL;
   ```

3. **Hide verification banner:**
   ```typescript
   // In app/[locale]/(student)/student/page.tsx
   // Comment out banner component
   ```

## Success Criteria

✅ **MVP Complete When:**
- [x] Unverified students cannot enroll
- [x] Verification banner shows on dashboard
- [x] Verification flow works end-to-end
- [x] Verified badge displays correctly
- [x] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] i18n messages compiled

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly in development**
2. **Integrate Resend for production emails**
3. **Create email templates**
4. **Add verification to registration flow**
5. **Monitor verification rates**
6. **Gather user feedback**
7. **Implement Phase 2 features**
